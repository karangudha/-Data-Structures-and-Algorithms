Data structure

# Linear data structure

## 1. Array

It is a collection of same type of element stored in continous memory location.

You can think it of like, some box are placed in a line and all boxes contain some value or number.

### Example:
```c
int arr[5];
````

### Decleration:

1. `type def arr[n];` :- array of n size.
2. `int arr[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};` :- Declaration and initialization of array.
3. `int arr[ ] = {1, 2, 3, 4};` :- You can declare array without size, compiler automatically detect array size.
